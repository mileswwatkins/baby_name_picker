Baby Name Picker
================

Iteratively choose a baby name using filtered Social Security birth data

The user can filter a particular year of baby names, with options including length, commonness, gendering, and name variant handling (eg, Will vs William). Once this list has been filtered, they are repeatedly presented with a small, random set of names from that list to consider; all names not chosen get thrown out. Repeat this step until only the favorite names are left!
